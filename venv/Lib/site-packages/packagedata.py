Compatibility module for pkg_resources deprecation.

Use of pkg_resources is deprecated as an API in favor of importlib.resources.

The problem is that importlib.resources is only available in Python 3.9+, so
if you maintain a package that needs compatibility with an earlier version of
Python, you need to install the backported version importlib-resources:

In your requirements.txt or equivalent:

    importlib-resources; python_version < "3.9"
    importlib-metadata; python_version < "3.9"

This package provides those requirements, library selection and a compatibility
layer to ease the migration from pkg_resources.

The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30.
You may pin to setuptools<81 to avoid breakage until you can migrate.

See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html.
